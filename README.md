# Repository for code from the Low Resource NLP research project
The purpose of the Low Resource NLP research project is to adapt code from the SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task 0 to carry out morphological inflection specifically on low-resource languages.
The directory src-clean contains code drawn from https://github.com/sigmorphon2020/task0-baselines and subsequently edited to remove dead code and add docstrings to functions whose purpose was unclear.
